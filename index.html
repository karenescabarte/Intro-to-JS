						<h1>An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
						<p>
							Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve
							with it, and what other technologies play well with it.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div id="content">
						<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
						<p><em>JavaScript</em> was initially to "make web pages alive".</p>
						<p>
							The programs in this language are called <em>scripts</em>. They
							can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as
							the page loads.
						</p>
						<p>
							Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need
							special preparation or compilation to run.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
							called <a href="https://javascript.info/">Java.</a>
						</p>

						<div class="box1">
							<p>
								When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
								"LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
								decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother"
								of Java would help.
							</p>
							<p>
								But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent
								language with its own specification called
								<a href="#">ECMAScript</a>, and now it has no relation to Java
								at all.
							</p>
						</div>

						<p>
							Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
							the server, or actually on any device that has a special called
							<a href="#">JavaScript engine.</a>
						</p>

						<div class="box2">
							<h3>How do engines work?</h3>
							<p>Engines are complicated.But the basics are easy.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parses") the
									script.
								</li>
								<li>
									Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the machine
									language.
								</li>
								<li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process, it
								even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data
								that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code
								based on that knowledge.
							</p>
